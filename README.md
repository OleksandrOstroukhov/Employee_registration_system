# Employee Registration System

A simple console-based Python application for managing employee registrations at a workplace. This program allows you to register new employees, view the list of registered employees, update their information, and delete employee records.

## Features

- **Register Employee**: Add new employees with a unique ID, name, and position.
- **View Employees**: Display a list of all registered employees with their IDs, names, and positions.
- **Update Employee**: Modify the name or position of an existing employee.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove an employee's record from the system.
- **Data Persistence**: Employee data is stored in a JSON file (`employees.json`), allowing the data to persist across sessions.

## Requirements
